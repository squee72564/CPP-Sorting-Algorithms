# C++-Sorting-Algorithms
My Implementation of C++ Sorting algorithms.

My goal is to use templates to make use of the Iterators used for various container types. This would allow for one main function definition for each sorting algorithm that would apply to all containers. I am also implementing basic wrapper functions to make the calls to the sorting functions a little cleaner.

Topics learned with this project:

C++ iterator types
Template Programming
Sorting Algorithm Implementation
